        <h1> Raziya Naaz</h1>
        <h2>D.O.B: 23/02/1999</h2>
        <p>In Her Chidhood There was a girl who ventured out into the world daring to believe in her own equality, in her own freedom.

            She has lived in every time and place and class. Her quest has helped drive all of humankind's great struggles of emancipation, yet She has been marginalized and erased from those histories.
            
           The Girl Child has come a long, long way. She occupies a dangerously low social status - “the least of these” in a vast and historic hierarchy of being – as She struggles to find her way through centuries upon centuries of ancient traditions, beliefs, and norms that have defined Her more as a family “asset” than as a full human being.
            
            Well into the twenty-first century, Her body and very being are still caught in a tenuous tug-of-war between the supremacy systems of centuries past and the yet-to-be fulfilled ideals of what it means to be and live as a free people. As our global family is undergoing a long overdue reckoning around the racial legacy of slavery, our female ancestors cry from the grave #metoo!
            
            . She is free of and undefined by centuries upon centuries of diminishing ideology, theology, and traditions that treat being born female as lesser than, unclean, inferior, meant for submission, the cause of evil in the world. As not meant to grow into the full human agency and power of adulthood.
            
            She is the free spirit within each of us that comes into the world not knowing any of these rules, roles, and codes that await and define Her path. She is that scrappy voice within that presumes an equal place in the banquet of Life.
            
            She knows that her own freedom is bound up in the plight of others.
